# Image Compression
 
#### A greedy algorithm that iteratively adds shapes to a blank canvas until it sufficiently resembles the input image.
#### The input image format is BMP, and the result is saved as a BMP image; the output could be saved in a more efficient format, but would then need other software to display it.
#### Example input images and their results are saved in /test images
#### Before running, check that `TILE_WIDTH` and `TILE_HEIGHT` are set to even multiples of the width and height of the input image

## Example input
![](/test images/input1.bmp)
## Example output
![](/test images/output1.bmp)
